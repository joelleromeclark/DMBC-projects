			<p>Technology (from Greek  techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand") is the collection of tools, including machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures used by humans. Engineering is the discipline that seeks to study and design new technologies. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal spe-cies' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology and information technology.</p>
			
			<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological develop-ments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to com-munication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.  Not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.</p>
			
			<p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.</p>

		<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of tech-nology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; propo-nents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technologi-cal progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.</p>
		<blockquote>&ldquo;I have no luddite prejudice against new technology; it's just that books look as if they contain knowledge, while e-readers look as if they contain information.&rdquo;</blockquote>
